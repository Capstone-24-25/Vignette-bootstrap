## Basic Bootstrapping

**Bootstrap resampling/Bootstrapping** is the process, pretending that our sample represents some notional population, and taking repeated samples of size N with replacement from our original sample of size N.

We use bootstrapping when we canâ€™t feasibly take repeated samples from the same random process that generated our data, to see how our estimate changes from one sample to the next. The inability to resample is often due to factors such as the time-consuming nature of the process, the high cost of collecting additional data, and other practical constraints.

### Process

1.  Sampling from the population

2.  Making a bootstrapped data set

3.  Calculating some types of statistical metrics, like mean

4.  Keeping track of the metrics for each bootstrap sample

5.  Repeating steps 2 to 4 a bunch of times
