## Vignette abstract:

This is the template repository for Vignette project for Group 7 focusing on **bootstrapping**. We are going to introduce the resampling method -- bootstrapping-- in the following aspects:

-   the bootstrap sampling distribution,

-   bootstrap standard errors and confidence intervals,

-   how the bootstrap usually, but not always, works well.

Further, we will develop a model with bootstrap step by step to build better intuition on this method. Our data is from: [*https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/obesity-levels*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/obesity-levels){.uri} and we aim to *predict obesity levels*
