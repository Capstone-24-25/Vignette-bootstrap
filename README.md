## Vignette abstract:

This is the template repository for Vignette project for Group 7 focusing on **bootstrapping**. We are going to introduce the resampling method -- bootstrapping-- in the following aspects:

  - the bootstrap sampling distribution,
  
  - bootstrap standard errors and confidence intervals,
  
  - how the bootstrap usually, but not always, works well.
  
Further, we will develop a model with bootstrap step by step to build better intuition on this method. Our data is from: *url* and we aim to *Goal*
