## Basic Bootstrapping

**Bootstrap resampling/Bootstrapping** is the process, pretending that our sample represents some notional population, and taking repeated samples of size N with replacement from our original sample of size N.

We use bootstrapping when we can’t feasibly take repeated samples from the same random process that generated our data, to see how our estimate changes from one sample to the next. The inability to resample is often due to factors such as the time-consuming nature of the process, the high cost of collecting additional data, and other practical constraints.

### Process

1.  Sampling N individuals from the population.

2.  Obtain a sample of size N from the original dataset with replacement. This new sample is referred to as the bootstrapped dataset.

3.  Calculating some types of statistical metrics, like mean

4.  Keeping track of the metrics for each bootstrap sample.

5.  Repeating steps 2 to 4 a bunch of times

    Here is how bootstrapping looks like in a picture.

### Example

Imagine you want to estimate the average height of all adults in a city, but you only have a small sample of 100 individuals due to labor and money constraint. Calculating the sample mean gives you an estimate, but you’d also like to understand the variability of this estimate.

Using bootstrapping, you can simulate this process:

1.  From your original sample of 100 individuals, randomly draw 100 data points with replacement. This means some individuals might appear multiple times in the new dataset, while others might not appear at all.

2.  Calculate the mean height for this resampled dataset.

3.  Repeat this resampling process many times (e.g., 10,000 iterations), creating a distribution of mean heights.

[!!!]{style="color:red;"} This distribution of sample means (called the bootstrap distribution) allows you to estimate the standard error of the mean, construct confidence intervals, or test hypotheses about the population mean—all without requiring additional data collection.

### Assumption

1.  Bootstrapping assumes randomness in your data, and therefore the statistical uncertainty in your answer, arises from the process of sampling.

2.  Bootstrapping is also a good approximation for *other* common forms of randomness, including experimental randomization, measurement error, and intrinsic variability of some natural process.
